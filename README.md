# VCCore - VirtualCity@Chalmers Core

VirtualCity@Chalmers is a multidisciplinary research project at
Chalmers University of Technology involving researchers from
mathematics, architecture, civil engineering and computer science. The
aim is to develop an open multimodal data, simulation and
visualization platform for interactive planning, design, exploration,
experimentation and optimization of cities.

This repository contains the server side functionality, including
mesh generation, solvers and data processing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Deployment

In preparation.

## Components

The code in this repository is organized as a collection of independent but interoperable
components. Each component may be implemented using different libraries, and languages
(C++, Python, ...) but follows a common naming scheme and provides a standardized
command-line interface.

The following list summarizes the currently implemented (and planned components):

* vc-generate-mesh (finite element mesh generation)
* vc-simulate-foo (simulator in preparation)
* vc-simulate-bar (simulator in preparation)

## Versioning

We use [CalVer](https://calver.org/) for versioning.
