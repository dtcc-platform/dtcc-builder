# VCCore - VirtualCity@Chalmes Core

VirtualCity@Chalmers is a multidisciplinary research project at
Chalmers University of Technology involving researchers from
mathematics, architecture, civil engineering and computer science. The
aim is to develop an open multimodal data, simulation and
visualisation platform for interactive planning, design, exploration,
experimentation and optimisation of cities.

This repository contains the server side functionality, including
mesh generation, solvers and data processing.
