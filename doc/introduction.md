# Introduction

DTCC Builder is a mesh generator for automatic, efficient, and robust
mesh generation for large-scale city modeling and simulation.

Using standard and widely available raw data sources in the form of
point clouds and cadastral data, DTCC Builder generates high-quality
3D surface and volume meshes, suitable for both visualization and
simulation. In particular, DTCC Builder is capable of generating
large-scale, conforming tetrahedral volume meshes of cities suitable
for finite element (FEM) simulation.

Currently, only LoD1.2 city models are supported but the aim is to
generate both LoD1.3 and LoD2.x models.

The mesh generation algorithm relies on two key ideas. First, the mesh
generation is reduced from a 3D problem to a 2D problem by taking
advantage of the cylindrical geometry of extruded 2D footprints; a 2D
mesh respecting the boundaries of the buildings is generated by a 2D
mesh generator and then layered to form a 3D mesh. Second, the 3D mesh
is adapted to the geometries of building and ground by solving a
partial differential equation (PDE) with the ground and building
heights as boundary conditions (mesh smoothing). Together these two
ideas enable the creation of a both efficient and robust pipeline for
automated large-scale mesh generation from raw data. The algorithm is
described in detail in the paper [Digital twins for city simulation:
Automatic, efficient, and robust mesh generation for large-scale city
modeling and simulation](TBD).
